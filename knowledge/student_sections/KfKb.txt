Section Identity
The Chemistry with Physics and Biotechnology Section (KfKb-sektionen) is a student division for students studying Biotechnology and Chemistry with Physics at Chalmers, plus master's programs including Innovative and Sustainable Chemical Engineering (MPISC) and Biotechnology (MPBIO). Founded in 1996 when students from Chemistry with Biology (K-sektionen) and Chemistry with Physics (F-sektionen) formed the joint KfKb-sektionen. Today consists of approximately 400 members. Section colors are green and black, and patron saints are Darth Vader and Yoda (changed from Gaston in 2013).

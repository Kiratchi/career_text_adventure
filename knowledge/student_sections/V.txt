Section Traditions

Gamble Culture
Strong tradition of older students ("Gamble") mentoring and guiding new students through their Chalmers journey. Based on the narrative that ancient builders of Gothenburg pass down their construction knowledge to each new generation.

Nollan and Phadder System
New students are called "Nollan" and are guided by older students ("phaddrar") during reception. This mentorship system creates strong bonds and support networks.

Construction Heritage
Deep connection to Gothenburg's building history and construction traditions, with section identity rooted in the story of building the city "from three sticks and a handful of gravel."

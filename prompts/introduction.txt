Setting and Atmosphere:
    - The story begins at Götaplatsen, a well-known square in Gothenburg, where the new student has just arrived.

    - The huge traditional student welcome is in full swing, with loud music, cheering crowds, and confused but curious new students.

Content Guidelines:
    - Welcome the student and describe the festive and slightly chaotic arrival at Götaplatsen.
    - Introduce Chalmers briefly as a historic and innovative university in Gothenburg.
    - Emphasize the atmosphere, the crowd, the statue, and the start of something big.
    - If you mention Poseidon's white lab coat, mention it simply as a festive detail—avoid explanations about experiments, chemistry, or the specific traditions behind it
    - End with someone asking the student which program they've chosen or are attending — this leads to the next step in the adventure.

Writing Style:
    - Tone: Friendly, vivid, slightly whimsical, and immersive — like a helpful older student or guide.
    - Perspective: Second person ("you") to pull the player into the story.
    - Avoid sounding like an ad or formal guide. Make it feel like a real, lived moment.

The text should end with a question about which program they have chosen.

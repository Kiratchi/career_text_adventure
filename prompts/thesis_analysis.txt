You are the Director of a university life simulation game. A master's student in their final year has reached a crucial decision point: selecting their thesis project. This is a pivotal moment that will shape their academic completion and career trajectory.

STUDENT PROFILE:

Name: {student_name}
Program: {program} (Year {year})
Masters Program: {masters_program}

PROGRAM CONTEXT:
{program_explanation}

STUDENT'S ACADEMIC JOURNEY:
{comprehensive_history}

ESTABLISHED PERSONALITY TRAITS:
{personality_summary}

YOUR TASK:

Create a realistic thesis project selection scenario based on this student's unique profile. The scenario should present a situation where the student must choose between different thesis project options that align with their:
- Academic interests and strengths developed throughout their journey
- Program requirements and research areas available in their field
- Career aspirations and post-graduation goals
- Personal working style and research preferences

CONSIDER THESE THESIS SELECTION FACTORS:

- Research approach: Theoretical vs. applied research
- Career pathway: PhD preparation vs. industry readiness
- Working style: Independent research vs. collaborative projects
- Impact focus: Academic contribution vs. practical application
- Timeline and scope: Ambitious long-term vs. manageable short-term projects
- Resources needed: Lab-based vs. field work vs. computational
- Supervisor relationships: Established faculty vs. visiting researchers vs. industry mentors

RESPONSE FORMAT:

ANALYSIS: 
[Analyze what type of thesis selection scenario would be most engaging and realistic for this specific student. Consider their personality, academic development, career goals, and the natural decision points they would face when choosing a thesis project.]

SCENARIO_TYPE: 
[Specify the type of thesis selection scenario, such as: "competing_research_opportunities", "industry_vs_academic_choice", "interdisciplinary_collaboration_decision", "high_risk_high_reward_dilemma", "specialization_vs_breadth_choice", etc.]

IMPORTANT:
- Focus on creating a thesis project selection scenario that feels authentic to this student's established character
- The scenario should present meaningful choices that reflect real graduate school decisions
- Consider both the academic and personal factors that influence thesis project selection
- This sets up the decision framework - specific thesis project details will be generated separately
